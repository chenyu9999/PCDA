P-A: The Baidu MiniApp Boss Recruitment is a commonly used miniApp for job searching, which uses the swan.getClipboardData() API to retrieve the data in user clipboard. Since the API can lead to an m-scope, the clipboard could be used without any permissions, which may be exploited by a malicious miniApp to hijack the personal information stored in the clipboard via a fake access.
