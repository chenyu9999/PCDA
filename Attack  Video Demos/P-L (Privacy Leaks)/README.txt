P-L: The TikTok MiniApp Location Treasure is used for selecting and saving user locations, which uses the tt.chooseLocation() interface to display a specific geographical location. However, this API is redundantly mapped to scope.location, i.e., r-scope, requiring users to grant unnecessary location permission when using it. Subsequently, the miniApp can continuously retrieve the userâ€™s location in the background using the getLocation() method, leading to privacy leak.
