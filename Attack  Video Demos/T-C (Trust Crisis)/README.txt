T-C: The TencentQQ MiniApp Flower Lover is designed to identify different types of flowers, which uses the qq.chooseImage() API to access the userâ€™s photo album and retrieve information about the flowers in the album. However, TencentQQ mistakenly maps this API to scope.chooseImage rather than scope.camera, resulting in an m-scope. This directly causes the permission page to display "Permission to select pictures" instead of "camera" or "album," preventing users from managing their camera or album permissions, which can lead to a trust crisis for the miniApp among users.
