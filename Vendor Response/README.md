To gain insights from the SuperApp developers, we reported the scope misalignment issues and some typical misaligned APIs (e.g., qq.chooseVideo(), wx.getClipboardData(), swan.getClipboardData()) to the corresponding superApp development teams, including Baidu/TikTok/Tencent Security Response Center (SRC), and WeChat Support Teams. To date, we have received 8 positive responses, including 6 vulnerability confirmations with rewards: 1 high-risk from Baidu SRC, 2 medium-risk from Tencent SRC, 2 medium-risk from CNVD (CNVD-2024-17003, CNVD-2024-15202) and 1 low-risk from TikTok SRC. 

Specifically, Baidu SRC and Tencent SRC recognised the great importance of the scope misalignment issues, classifying them as high-risk and medium-risk vulnerabilities, respectively. Tencent SRC places them into their core business area with a threat score of 5 (the highest score among medium-risks) with a contribution value of 175 (the highest value among medium-risks). The responses from these superApp developers indicate a high level of acknowledgement of the scope misalignment issues, affirming the practical security value of our study results.
